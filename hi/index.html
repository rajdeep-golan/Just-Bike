Where there is sufficient space to do so, two riders/drivers may ride side by side if this can be done without danger or undue inconvenience. If the signal for overtaking has been given, rider/driver are not permitted to ride side by side unless traffic conditions permit or necessitate this. Never ride a vehicle with three or more wheels next to another bicycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 2</strong> Vehicles should always keep to the right in the lane located to the far right in the direction of traffic. However, the lane next to it can be used when overtaking if it cannot be done to the right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 3</strong> Before crossroads, the rider/driver going straight ahead or turning left, regardless of Section 16 (1)(3) must continue to keep to the right on the road. However, if one or more lanes are reserved for road users turning right at the marking, the rider/driver may position themself at the line between the nearest lane not reserved for right-turning road users and the right-turn lane. Rider/driver wishing to turn left must continue through the crossroad to its opposite side, first making the turn when it can be done without inconvenience to traffic. This applies regardless of markings, unless it appears that these apply to rider/driver. Points 1-4 also apply when riding across or away from the roadway outside of the crossroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 4</strong> Rider/driver must always have both feet on the pedals and at least one hand on the handlebars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 5</strong> It is forbidden to ride/drive on the pavement or footpath, unless otherwise provided by the rules set by the Minister of Justice cf. Section 14(4). Rider/driver may ride across pavements and footpaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 6</strong> While riding, rider/driver are not allowed to hold onto another vehicle or to the driver or passenger of another vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 7</strong> When parking vehicles, it is recommended that the vehicle be locked unless the parking period is relatively brief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Section 50</strong> People under the age of 18 are not allowed to ride/drive .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subsection 2</strong> A vehicle may not carry more people than it is designed to carry.

Objects that are carried must not prevent the rider/driver from having full control of the vehicle or using the proper hand signals. The Ministry for Transport may set provisions on the maximum length, width, height and weight of objects carried on vehicles specially designed for the carriage of goods, as well as on trailers and sidecars for vehicles.</p>\r\n"

In 2020, approx. 80% of City Motorcycle users are Indians.</span></span></span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span>Just Bike vehicles are run by The City and Commuter bike Foundation, which is a private, commercial fund.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span>Just Bike is a non-profit - all profits from the City vehicles must be reinvested in the City Vehicles system in accordance with the City and Commuter Vehicle Foundation's Articles of Association.</span></span></span></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">More in details</span></strong></span></span></span><br />\r\n<span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Just Bike won a private American-Indian tender written by RSG in collaboration with Jharkhand and Washinton municipalities in 2020. The metro company also contributed in handling the tender.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The tender was shared in accordance with all applicable rules, and up to the application deadline, several meetings were held where interested parties could meet and enter into collaborations if they so desired.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">One of the reasons why Just Bike won the tender was that it was \"the most economically advantageous offer\". Furthermore, Just Bike was visionary and offered some options that similar systems in other major cities could not offer - including reservation of vehicles and handover of vehicles next to full BycyJust Just Bike stations. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The ambition behind the new urban vehicles system was to establish a ”4. component in public transportation” that could transport the traveler the last mile between A and B.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Specific functionalities of Just Bike that support this ambition are:</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span>Real-time view of the trip on the Just Bike app</span></span></span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ability to drop off your city vehicles, even if there is no space in the Just Bike HUB, so you can still reach your train, bus, or subway.</span></span></span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span><span><span>Just Bike HUBS at 46 train/metrostations.</span></span></span></span></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Also, Just Bike's vehicles with their motor assistance, were to help promote green and congestion-reducing mobility across municipal boundaries.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Just Bike is primarily a commuter vehicle which, with its minute/hour/day/month payment structure and the need for recharging, provides transport from A to B.</p>\r\n"
